profile:
  - I'm a full-stack and mobile software engineer with 5+ years of experience in the software development industry (including development, automation, and quality assurance), and I love to build and fix things. I love taking part in hackathons and developing various apps using different stacks. My strongest languages are Ruby, JavaScript, and Java. I've used Ruby on Rails and AngularJS in my professional work. I've also coded Android apps in side projects and I've picked up Objective-C and Python various projects and hackathons. I tend to be agnostic in the languages and stack being used in a given project, and I am able to learn new things very quickly.
  - Feel free to reach out to me if you feel that my expertise is a good fit for your project or team!
